  abstract={
    Unease over data privacy will retard consumer acceptance of IoT
    deployments. The primary source of discomfort is a lack of user
    control over raw data that is streamed directly from sensors to the
    cloud. This is a direct consequence of the over-centralization of
    todayâ€™s cloud-based IoT hub designs. We propose a solution that
    interposes a locally-controlled software component called a privacy
    mediator on every raw sensor stream. Each mediator is in the same
    administrative domain as the sensors whose data is being collected,
    and dynamically enforces the current privacy policies of the owners
    of the sensors or mobile users within the domain. This solution necessitates
    a logical point of presence for mediators within the administrative
    boundaries of each organization. Such points of presence
    are provided by cloudlets, which are small locally-administered data
    centers at the edge of the Internet that can support code mobility.
    The use of cloudlet-based mediators aligns well with natural personal
    and organizational boundaries of trust and responsibility.

  abstract={
    A cognitive assistance application combines a wearable device such
    as Google Glass with cloudlet processing to provide step-by-step
    guidance on a complex task. In this paper, we focus on user assistance
    for narrow and well-defined tasks that require specialized
    knowledge and/or skills. We describe proof-of-concept implementations
    for four different tasks: assembling 2D Lego models, freehand
    sketching, playing ping-pong, and recommending context-relevant
    YouTube tutorials. We then reflect on the difficulties we faced in
    building these applications, and suggest future research that could
    simplify the creation of similar applications.

  abstract={
    When offloading computation from a mobile device, we show
    that it can pay to perform additional on-device work in order
    to reduce the offloading workload. We call this offload shaping,
    and demonstrate its application at many different levels
    of abstraction using a variety of techniques. We show that
    offload shaping can produce significant reduction in resource
    demand, with little loss of application-level fidelity

    This paper shares our experiences building and benchmarking Spindle as an open
    source Spark-based web analytics platform. Spindle's design has been
    motivated by real-world queries and data requiring concurrent, low latency
    query execution. We identify a search space of Spark tuning options and study
    their impact on Spark's performance. Results from a self-hosted six node
    cluster with one week of analytics data (13.1GB) indicate tuning options such
    as proper partitioning can cause a 5x performance improvement.

  abstract={
    The complicated process by which a yeast cell divides, known as the cell
    cycle, has been modeled by a system of 26 nonlinear ordinary differential
    equations (ODEs) with 149 parameters. This model captures the chemical
    kinetics of the regulatory networks controlling the cell division process
    in budding yeast cells. Empirical data is discrete and matched against
    discrete inferences (e.g., whether a particular mutant cell lives or dies)
    computed from the ODE solution trajectories. The problem of
    estimating the ODE parameters to best fit the model to the data is a
    149-dimensional global optimization problem attacked by the deterministic
    algorithm VTDIRECT95 and by the nondeterministic algorithms differential
    evolution, QNSTOP, and simulated annealing, whose performances are
    compared.

    A serial Fortran 95 implementation of the QNSTOP algorithm is presented.
