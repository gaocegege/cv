  abstract={
    High-data-rate sensors, such as video cameras, are becoming ubiquitous in the
    Internet of Things. This article describes GigaSight, an Internet-scale
    repository of crowd-sourced video content, with strong enforcement of privacy
    preferences and access controls. The GigaSight architecture is a federated
    system of VM-based cloudlets that perform video analytics at the edge of the
    Internet, thus reducing the demand for ingress bandwidth into the cloud.
    Denaturing, which is an owner-specific reduction in fidelity of video content
    to preserve privacy, is one form of analytics on cloudlets. Content-based
    indexing for search is another form of cloudlet-based analytics. This article
    is part of a special issue on smart spaces.

  abstract={
    Recent cyberattacks have highlighted the risk of physical equipment operating
    outside designed tolerances to produce catastrophic failures. A related
    threat is cyberattacks that change the design and manufacturing of a
    machine's part, such as an automobile brake component, so it no longer
    functions properly. These risks stem from the lack of cyber-physical models
    to identify ongoing attacks as well as the lack of rigorous application of
    known cybersecurity best practices. To protect manufacturing processes in the
    future, research will be needed on a number of critical cyber-physical
    manufacturing security topics.
